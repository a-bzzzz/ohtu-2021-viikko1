Bash (Unix shell)

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.[11][12] First released in 1989,[13] it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions.[14] A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.[15] It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.[16] Bash was also the default shell in all versions of Apple macOS prior to the 2019 release of macOS Catalina, which changed the default shell to zsh, although Bash currently remains available as an alternative shell.[17]
